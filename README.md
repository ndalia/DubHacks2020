To Do
1. graphics
    a) among us person + child
    b) replace ghost w maskless ppl
2. 6 feet apart- prolly hardest part
    modify algorithm w distance formula so we get collision when <= 6 feet
    ghosts DO NOT have to be 6 feet apart
3. more imporantly, figure out which pacman files we need, copy/paste them over

Need to differentiate from Pacman
- new map?
- new color scheme- amongus color scheme?

Making it more technically intense
