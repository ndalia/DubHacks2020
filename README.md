"# DubHacks2020" Raising COVID awareness throughout teens through an interactive game!

The goal of the game is to use the arrow keys to move the user (among us crewmate) from the start to the exit. The user has to maintain approproriate social distancing from the other people in the grid while navigating to the exit, or else the user will contract COVID and have to start over.
"# DubHacks2020" 
To Do
1. graphics
    a) among us person + child
    b) replace ghost w maskless ppl
2. 6 feet apart- prolly hardest part
    modify algorithm w distance formula so we get collision when <= 6 feet
    ghosts DO NOT have to be 6 feet apart
3. more imporantly, figure out which pacman files we need, copy/paste them over

Need to differentiate from Pacman
- new map?
- new color scheme- amongus color scheme?

Making it more technically intense
