"# DubHacks2020" Raising COVID awareness throughout teens through an interactive game!

The goal of the game is to use the arrow keys to move the user (among us crewmate) from the start to the exit. The user has to maintain approproriate social distancing from the other people in the grid while navigating to the exit, or else the user will contract COVID and have to start over.
